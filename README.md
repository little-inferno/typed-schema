# Welcome to Typed Schema
Typed schema is an http service definition DSL, currently translating to [akka-http Routes](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/routing-dsl/overview.html) and [OpenApi 3.0 definition](https://swagger.io/specification/) inspired by the [haskell-servant](http://haskell-servant.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library.

## Getting started
Typed Schema is published to Maven Central and cross-built for Scala `2.12` and `2.13` so you can just add the following to your build:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= List(
  "ru.tinkoff" %% "typed-schema-swagger" % "latest version in badge",
  "ru.tinkoff" %% "typed-schema-finagle-zio" % "latest version in badge",
  "ru.tinkoff" %% "typed-schema-finagle-custom" % "latest version in badge",
)
```

or 

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= List(
  "ru.tinkoff" %% "typed-schema-swagger"        % "latest version in badge",
  "ru.tinkoff" %% "typed-schema-finagle-env"    % "latest version in badge",
  "ru.tinkoff" %% "typed-schema-finagle-custom" % "latest version in badge",
)
```
or

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= List(
  "ru.tinkoff" %% "typed-schema-swagger"   % "latest version in badge",
  "ru.tinkoff" %% "typed-schema-akka-http" % "latest version in badge",
)
```

## Motivation
We the People building services using modern scala often struggling to satisfy following requirements
* Service implementation should be checked to be compatible with OpenApi 3.0 specifications at the compile time
* Service definition should be detachable from the implementation and exportable as mere specification
* There should be an easy way to migrate all the services to different effect\future\task implementation
without changing any definition
* There should be some way to migrate all the service to another framework without reimplementing them
